            of an error in the website, I collect data and information (through

          <Typography>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used
            as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from
            the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
            memory. This service does not use these "cookies" explicitly.
            However, the website may use third-party code and libraries that use
            "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. You
            have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies, and you
            will know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose

            I want to inform users of this service that these third parties have
            access to their personal information. The reason is to perform the

            not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

          <Typography>
            I value your trust in providing us with your personal information,
            so we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of
            protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the

            reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

            How long we keep your information

          <Typography>
            We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to
            fulfil the purpose for which this data was collected and any other
            permitted linked purpose (for example certain transaction details
            and correspondence related to any legal services we provide may be
            retained until the time limit for claims in respect of the
            transaction has expired or in order to comply with regulatory
            requirements regarding the retention of such data). If your personal
            data is used for two purposes we will retain it until the purpose
            with the latest period expires; but we will stop using it for the
            purpose with a shorter period once that period expires. Our
            retention periods are also based on our business needs and good
            practice.

            How we transfer, store and protect your data
          </Typography>

          <Typography>
            We are committed to protecting your data from third parties. That’s
            why it’s our strict policy never to sell your personal information
            to anyone. We don’t share information that personally identifies you
            with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to.
            For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select
            the 'tap to call' button, we’ll connect your call and may share your
            phone number with the flower shop. If you’re using an Android
            device, we require third-party apps to ask for your permission to
            access certain types of data – like your photos, contacts or
            location.

            delete it from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you
